# Sortable

Sortable is a JavaScript library for reorderable drag-and-drop lists. This fork exists to implement the changes in [SortableJS/Sortable#2095](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable/pull/2095): "Prevent ignored touches on Android Chrome." You probably shouldn't use this fork, as once it's unnecessary it will be deleted.
